5. Which parts of this assignment did you have trouble with, if any?
The biggest headache was creating a user account on my web server.
I followed the steps from the lecture notes, but the ssh-copy-id 
always failed with a "Permission denied (publickey)." I was stuck 
on this for a while until i just figured out a way to create a .ssh
folder, copy the key from root, and change the permissions of the
file.
