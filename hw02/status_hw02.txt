4. How many HTML / CSS tutorial exercises did you do?

5. How comfortable do you feel with HTML and CSS now?
Fairly comfortable. I have a much better understanding of CSS
than I did a week ago.

6. How many JS tutorial exercises did you do?
I looked over most of the tutorials and exercises, but I
just skimmed a lot of them because there were a lot of 
basic programming tutorials.

7. How comfortable do you feel with JS now?
I feel more comfortable, but it will still take some getting
used to. Dealing with scope and anonymous functions was an
adjustment.

8. Do all of your HTML pages pass the W3C HTML validator?
(https://validator.w3.org/)
No


9. Which parts of this assignment did you have trouble with, if any?
Trying to make every letter a different color with just a style
tag in the head was tricky, but i ended up just making a custom
class for each letter that only contained a color.

I was able to figure out most of the logic for the calculator, but
ran into trouble with a few edge cases, perhaps due to shortcomings
of my program design.
