Please fill in answers to the questions below:


1. What's your name?
Will Bridges

2. What hostname did you deploy to?
hw05.willbridges.website

3. Which parts of this assignment did you have trouble with, if any?
The biggest obstacle was getting my page to render after I began
moving logic over to Elixir. I was getting a blank page for a while
before I checked the console and realized I was missing an import
and my view wasn't properly set up. I also ran into issues writing
the browser logic because of state functions being undefined when
the page loaded.

4. What part of your application state is on the server?
The server contains the secret and all relevant game information
that the browser needs to render.

5. What part of your application state, if any, is in the browser?
The browser receives everything it needs to render the current game
state. This includes the list of guesses, hints, the message to
be rendered after a guess, and remaining lives. It never receives
the secret from the server.
